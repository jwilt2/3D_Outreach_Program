Preferred materials:
========
* An FDM printer, Prusa, Ultimake, Monoprice, Ender, etcâ€¦

* Some Thermoplastic 3D Printing filament: 

    o	  If you print with PLA say its made from corn! 

    o	  If you print with ABS say you are printing with the same material Legos are made of!
    
    o	  If you are printing with PET/PETG say you are printing with he same materials water bottles are made of!
    
* Some form of cart or table to elevate the printer for people to see.
    
* Use a G-code file to print as you are talking and finishes when you are done. Preferably printing a few small objects such as gears or symbols relevant to the event that can       be given out. Check these out!

Tips:
===================
* Know your audience! It is critical that you know your audience and their expertise level. The emphasis of this program will be on presenting to children and novice audiences.

* Some of the questions/jargon may be best engaged to slightly more technical audiences. Here I split green to being for a general novice audience but red being added in for a       more experienced audience/questions.

* When presenting to elementary school and middle school children they have very creative suggestions for printing so go along with it because you really can print almost           everything!
