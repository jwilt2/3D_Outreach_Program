Preferred materials:
========
•	  An FDM printer, Prusa, Ultimake, Monoprice, Ender, etc…

•	  Some Thermoplastic 3D Printing filament: 

    o	  If you print with PLA say its made from corn! 

    o	  If you print with ABS say you are printing with the same material Legos are made of!
    
    o	  If you are printing with PET/PETG say you are printing with he same materials water bottles are made of!
    
•	  Some form of cart or table to elevate the printer for people to see.
    
•	  Use a G-code file to print as you are talking and finishes when you are done. Preferably printing a few small objects such as gears or symbols relevant to the event that can       be given out. Check these out!
